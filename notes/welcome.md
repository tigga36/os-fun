# OS Development Endeavour

This series covers the steps taken to learn the basics of OS development. While the objective is to familiarize myself with basic concepts of OS to help with binary CTF problems, I will probably be stuck learning about something else along the way. Much of the notes here will, much like everywhere else, be for personal future reference.

At the point of beginning my writing, I had already ran through (and forgotten) a lot about the lowest-level OS development: BIOS and startup. While void of any high-level languages and data structures that you see in usual binary problems, I figure it would be useful to me to go through it again and document the process. But for now, for the sake of motivation, I will begin my writing from writing the Kernel.
